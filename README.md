# geoserver-rest-js

Using javascript (with jQuery), it provides functions to use Geoserver REST API. It also provides a HTML GUI using Handsontable to ease Geoserver manipulations.

##Installation

You can use **geoserver.js** directly in your application or get all the files to use the GUI. Since it uses **XHR requests**, the best way to make it work is to put it in a folder in your **geoserver** webapp or in you webapp in the same server as **Geoserver** to avoid some Cross origin problems :-)
Currently only Basic auth is provided.

##Version
